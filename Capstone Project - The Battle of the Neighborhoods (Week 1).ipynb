    "The objective of this capstone project is to analyse and select the best locations in Moscow city to open a new coffee shop. Using data science methodology and machine learning techniques like clustering, this project aims to provide solutions to answer the business question: In the city of Moscow, Russia, if a businessman is looking to open a new coffee shop, where would you recommend that they open it?"

    "This project is particularly useful to property developers and investors looking to open or invest in new coffee shops in Moscow city. This project is timely as the city is currently suffering from oversupply of coffee shops. But many of them are closing as the location is not optimal. Data from the Morgan & Mallet International Russia released last year showed that almost 20% of new opened coffee shops in 2018, were closed in the same year."

    "* List of neighborhoods in Moscow. This defines the scope of this project which is confined to the city of Moscow, the capital city of Russia\n",
    "* Latitude and longitude coordinates of those neighbourhoods. This is required in order to plot the map and also to get the venue data\n",

    "This Wikipedia page (https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Municipal_divisions_of_Moscow) contains a list of neighbourhoods in Moscow, with a total of 134 neighbourhoods. We will use web scraping techniques to extract the data from the Wikipedia page, with the help of Python requests and beautifulsoup packages. Then we will get the geographical coordinates of the neighbourhoods using Python Geocoder package which will give us the latitude and longitude coordinates of the neighbourhoods. After that, we will use Foursquare API to get the venue data for those neighbourhoods. Foursquare has one of the largest database of 105+ million places and is used by over 125,000 developers. Foursquare API will provide many categories of the venue data, we are particularly interested in the Coffee shop category in order to help us to solve the business problem put forward. This is a project that will make use of many data science skills, from web scraping (Wikipedia), working with API (Foursquare), data cleaning, data wrangling, to machine learning (K-means clustering) and map visualization (Folium). In the next section, we will present the Methodology section where we will discuss the steps taken in this project, the data analysis that we did and the machine learning technique that was used."
